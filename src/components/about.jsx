                    <p>
Thank You for Visiting. My name is Edwina Ulises and I am a business-oriented tech professional. My natural inclination is toward compact messaging for marketing campaigns as well as front-end and/or back-end web developement. This can come in the form of creating short video spots for social media or full on practical code solutions. I'm comfortable collaborating and developing the best outcome possible for corporate needs that involve technology</p>
<h1>Vision Statement  </h1>
<p>
My goal is to actively participate in technological solutions rooted in web applications and platforms that are focused on ethical, transparent, and accountable frameworks of business and commerce. I believe that in the 21st-century corporations must evolve to address the immediate needs of investors, customers, and global populations in an equitable and pragmatic way. 
</p>

<h1>Mission Statement  </h1>   
<p>Identifying the root causes and key performance indicators that inhibit inclusivity has been the focus of my executive experience thus far. This takes the form of leading fundraising events on behalf of NPO's such as the National Center for Lesbian Rights as well as actively engaging community leaders, such as Mara Keisling who is the founder of the National Center for Transgender Equality. Going forward I would like to join a team with free-commerce and CSR as drivers to growth.

                    <h3>Business</h3>
                    <p>My executive experience began shortly after finishing an MBA at American Public University with a concentration in I.T Management. I joined forces with like-minded individuals who aimed to launch an array of online platforms that target emerging markets and demographics like the website flashkiki.com. . As a Director Of Operations budget development, balance sheet configuration, and overall supervision were part of my duties. Recently, I am proudly working in disaster relief efforts for small businesses at the SBA.

                    <h3>Web-Based Strategy </h3>
                   <p> My approach in tackling essential work such as linear regression forecasting models, Return on Advertising Expense Reports, as well as Profit and Loss Reporting, for example,   has been squarely rooted in web-based platforms like WordPress, Bootstrap, Node.js, and React.  In other words, data management is a key strategic component of the type of work I do. I can manipulate data whether it is from a relational database like SQL, or object-oriented like MongoDB. Additionally I can perform testing and quality assurance on customer focused platforms and identify exactly how to optimize the platform.</p>
